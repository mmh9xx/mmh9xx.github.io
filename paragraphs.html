My name is Mackenna Hale and I'm currently a sophomore at the University of Missouri. I just changed my major to IT this past semester, and I think it's a better fit than my last major. I am excited about all the opportunities IT has to offer and the various different career paths it provides. I am currently in pursuit of an internship for over the summer involving IT so hopefully I will be able to add that experience to my resume soon.
